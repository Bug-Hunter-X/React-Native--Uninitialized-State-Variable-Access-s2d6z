This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common when using the useState hook in React Native, especially in functional components.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Error: count might be undefined here if the component hasn't rendered yet
  const doubledCount = count * 2;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{doubledCount}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
